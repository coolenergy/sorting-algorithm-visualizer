# Sorting algorithm visualizer

Welcome to my sorting algorithm visualizer, a learning tool built with React, Typescript, Tailwind, and unit testing with Vitest.

I decided to build this application to make the process of learning sorting algorithms more fun by visualizing them in action. I hope you enjoy playing around with it as much as I enjoyed coding it, you can check it out [HERE!](https://sorting-algorithm-visualizer-geraosf.vercel.app/)
